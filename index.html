                            I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a bachelor’s degree in interdiscplinary studies, focusing on psychology and writing, which led to a career in communication and a passion for creative writing.</p>
                
                            <p>In my current role as Employee Communications Coordinator at Valencia College, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to brainstorm and conceptualized original ideas for development of various types of employee communication - both digital and print.
                            Because I am the coordinator, I am involved in all stages of the work - from brainstorming and concepting to content development and design to implementation and delivery.</p>
                
                            <p>Another facet of my work includes project management, communication planning and strategic work. 
                            Specifically, for project management, I am directly responsible for projects that require graphic design, video, tech support and website edits. 
                            I am also involved with website development, creating communication plans and acting as a liaison for photography projects.</p>
                            
                            <p>Dring my tenure at Valencia College, I led two major system transitions — one for editorial management (DivvyHQ) and the other for our email marketing management system (PoliteMail), both of which required systems thinking, organization, attention to detail and adaptation. 
                            I was also actively involved in our project management system transition (LiquidPlanner), too, contributing to the strategic design of workflows and system development.  </p>
                            
                            <p>In my free time, when I'm not taking in Florida’s gems, I'm spending time with family, spending too much money on Pokemon Go, standing in line for another rice bowl at Sus-Hi Eatstation, writing superpower-inspired science fiction, or studying The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1. 
                            (I'm still waiting for that letter from Hogwarts … pesky owls.).</p>
